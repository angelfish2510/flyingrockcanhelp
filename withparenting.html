          <h2> <i>Parents Aren't Perfect</i></h2>
          <p>There is no one way, there is no right way.  This is critical for us as parents to remember daily.  Parenting has its ups and downs, most of us will have days where we go to bed and fall asleep thinking "I rocked at parenting today" and other days where we go to bed and lie awake stewing "I failed at parenting today".  We feel great when we replay the successful moments and get down on ourselves when we rehash the not-so-great.  We can read every parenting resource that exists (ok maybe that's not physically possible but you get the idea) and still have "one of those days".  Whether it's from new and unknown situations, exhaustion, emotional depletion, or just too much on our plates we will always have areas of parenting we don't want to deal with or wish we could deal with better.

            No matter how much knowledge and expertise we may have there is no substitute for a sense of community and comradery among parents.  Personally I feel a sense of relief when I learn that other parents are experiencing similar behavior issues or battles, it normalizes the challenges for us.  Being able to bounce ideas off of each other, hear what works and doesn't work for other parents can help us not only have ideas of how to handle various situations but also build our confidence in approaching some daily parenting woes.
            
            My hope is to create a forum that opens up dialogue and support for fellow parents.  Whether it's navigating work-life-balance, helping your anxious child, coping with post-divorce dynamics, or enduring the bliss of hormonal shifts in our children, I would love to share my experience and learn from other parents.
            
            One approach may work perfectly for some families while reeking havoc for others.  So much of parenting is trial and error, and together we can have a larger pool of floatation devices to reach for.</p>

            <!-- <p>Hi, my name is Kerikay Franzine Briceno and I am a proud scholarship recipient from Access To Opportunity (ATO). I was ecstatic and appreciative to learn that I was a recipient for a scholarship to complete my bachelor’s degree in Primary Education. ATO provided me with the opportunity to further my studies. I recently completed my degree and I’m grateful to the supporters at ATO. I’m currently a primary school teacher, and this opportunity has had a tremendous impact on my level of exposure. It has allowed me to a gain a better understanding of the teaching profession. It also allowed me to enhance my knowledge on how to work with children. I’m forever grateful, as this will allow me to cater for my students as well as their needs.  By assisting me, I was able to place my sole focus on work, my family and the most important aspect of school, learning. Your generosity has inspired me to help others and give back to the community.  I hope one day I will be able to help students achieve their goals just as you have helped me.</p>

            <h3>Why I Share My Thoughts</h3>
            <p>
                With a BS in Human Development & Family Science with a focus on Early Childhood Education I felt pretty confident going into parenting.  Knowing that I had a lot of book-knowledge when it comes to young children has gone a long way.  But I always knew that once my children hit age 7-ish I would be flying blind.  And boy was I right about that.  Life takes us on paths we never could have expected.  Being a mom was always my dream and I consider myself the luckiest mom in the world to have my two school-age daughters.  I count my blessings and feel fortunate every day while also feeling ready to pull my hair out and tempted to escape to the Caribbean at the drop of a hat.
