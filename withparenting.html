            <!-- <p>Hi, my name is Kerikay Franzine Briceno and I am a proud scholarship recipient from Access To Opportunity (ATO). I was ecstatic and appreciative to learn that I was a recipient for a scholarship to complete my bachelor’s degree in Primary Education. ATO provided me with the opportunity to further my studies. I recently completed my degree and I’m grateful to the supporters at ATO. I’m currently a primary school teacher, and this opportunity has had a tremendous impact on my level of exposure. It has allowed me to a gain a better understanding of the teaching profession. It also allowed me to enhance my knowledge on how to work with children. I’m forever grateful, as this will allow me to cater for my students as well as their needs.  By assisting me, I was able to place my sole focus on work, my family and the most important aspect of school, learning. Your generosity has inspired me to help others and give back to the community.  I hope one day I will be able to help students achieve their goals just as you have helped me.</p>
