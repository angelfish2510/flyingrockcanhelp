            <h3>Why <i>Flying Rock?</i></h3>
            <p>From as early as I can recall I was taught that the world is your oyster.  Work hard, practice kindness, appreciate what you have, and work towards what you want.  Because of this healthy philosophy I have had the joy and fortune of experiencing a broad array of endeavors and over the years developed many passions.  With that said there are always bumps in life's road and it took some very painful years to remember my roots and to once again see my wings.  I am very thankful to have learned all that I have thus far and to know there is so much more I want to learn.  I feel incredibly fortunate to have the support network that I have, the circumstances I have been given, and the wisdom to grab opportunity when you see or feel it.  My journey thus far is filled with experiences I would like to share, support I would like to provide, and community just waiting to be built.  As long as we remain grounded while seeing how far we can fly, the world can be our oyster.</p>
